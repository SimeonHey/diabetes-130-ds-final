## Loss function

Distributions to consider:

* Poisson distribution
* Negative Binomial Distribution
* Geometric distribution

To do:

* Discuss advantages/disadvantages of those and comment

* KS test distributions
* Write down the custom loss function for the best one and use it.

## Do the PCA thing

do it.

## Measurement

Implement early stopping and test what you have, then report

## Evaluation 

tSNE stuff
